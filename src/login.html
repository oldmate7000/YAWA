        <h2>A little about the log in...</h2>
        <p>Registration takes any unused username and there are no restricitons on password input.<br>
        Alternatively you may login using 'guest' as username and password (without the quotation marks) to see what the world has left you to view.
        </p>
        <h2>A little about this page...</h2>
        <p>If you had to wait a while for this page to load, I apologise for that. 
        If you refresh it now it should be running at a more regular pace.
        It's being hosted for free with Heroku and so they put it to sleep if no-one visits for 30 minutes. 
        Of course I could set something up to prevent that from happening, but I would consider that to be 'bad form' on my part.<br>
        This page has been created as a demo page to show use of MERN full-stack devolopment. 
        It's a simple weather app which takes its data from the free-tier 
        <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap</a> 5-day forecast API. 
        Why a weather app? Because it creates a chance to demonstrate use of authentication, state management and scripting, 
        responsive styling, database use, 3rd party API use, back-end setup and more all in one spot.
